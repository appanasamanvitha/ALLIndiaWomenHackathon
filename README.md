This Project can accurately notify the Level of Saline Bottle Level.The healthcare sector's rapid growth requires efficient management, but patient monitoring of saline levels is often overlooked. To address this, an automated "LOAD CELL based system" using Arduino and GSM MODULE is proposed to monitor saline levels and alert healthcare providers when levels are critical, preventing potential risks like air embolism and complications.

**How we Built it**

Steps we followed to successfully build the SALINE DETECTING SENSOR

1.Select the Sensor : We Choose a suitable sensor for detecting the liquid level in the saline bottle. 

2.Circuit Design : Design a circuit to interface the selected sensor with a microcontroller (ie., Arduino) or a dedicated sensor module.

3.Calibration: Calibrate the sensor to determine the reference points for the empty and full levels of the saline bottle. This step ensures accurate measurements and reliable detection.

4.Programming: We've Writen the necessary CPP code to read data from the sensor and perform the logic to detect the saline level.

5.Integration: Connect the sensor and microcontroller to the saline bottle or the part of the medical device where saline is stored.

6.Testing and Validation: We've Test the saline detecting sensor with different saline levels to verify its accuracy and reliability. 

7.Alerting Mechanism : To automate the alerting process, we had integrated a GSM module to send notifications to healthcare providers when the saline level reaches a critical point.
